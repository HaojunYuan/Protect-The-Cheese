M6 Test Deliverable
Our M6 design for Boss is that the boss cannot be defeated by the player. The player will feel sad and disappointed, however, when the boss reaches the monument, the boss regrets what he had done, and decided to be a good monster, and decided not to attack the monument. We want to surprise the player so that they enjoy the happiness.

For M6Tests, we did the following tests:

Confirm that different difficulty levels should have different money and health
Confirm that different towers should have different costs
Confirm that player can upgrade the tower by clicking on the bought tower to upgrade it
Confirm that if monument health<0 then lose screen should appear
Confirm that if the final boss reaches the monument, the player just wins the game
Lose screen and win screen should have different statistics
Confirm that if a monster gets defeated, the money should increase
Confirm that if the monument is attacked, the monument's health should decrease.
